Notes and code that help me learn rust lang

```zsh
# Create new project.
cargo new <project-name>

# Build binary and write it to <project-root>/target/debug/<project-name>
cargo build
# Compile with optimizations and write to <project-root>/target/release/<project-name>
cargo build --release

# Shortcut for building binary and running it.
cargo run

# Check to see if code compiles, but no executabl is outputted. Useful for  quicklychecking code.
cargo check
```
